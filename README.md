Welcome to the backend development branch of My health in your hands

![banner](Backend.webp)

## Overview
This branch is dedicated to the ongoing development of the backend components of our project. It serves as a workspace where developers can collaborate on backend-specific features, improvements, and bug fixes. By isolating backend development from the master branch, we ensure a stable production environment on the master branch while allowing for the continuous evolution of the backend functionality.

## Purpose
- Feature Development:
 New backend features and functionalities are implemented and tested here before being merged into the master branch for production
- Bug Fixes:
If any issues arise in the backend code, fixes are developed and tested on this branch to maintain the stability of the master branch.


## Guidelines for Contributors
- Branch Structure: Please create feature branches off this backend branch for any specific feature or enhancement. Once the work is complete, submit a pull request for review.
- Code Reviews: All changes will be subject to thorough code reviews to ensure code quality, maintainability, and adherence to project standards.
- Testing: Before submitting a pull request, ensure that relevant tests are included and that the changes have been tested thoroughly to avoid regressions.
- Documentation: Update documentation, if applicable, to reflect changes made in the backend code.
